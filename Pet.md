&bull; Imma redo that list soon, so it's in the same order as the bottom list to make it easier to navigate into. Someday when imma have time to check js I may include the picture directly in the Pet-List.

## Pet-List Embed Test

Pet without the __\[Rideable\]__ tag have a speed of 1:1, and those with it 2:1.

Only the Turtle is tag as __\[Tank\]__, but the Baby Mamoth and Bark Beetle should be too.

&bull; The caught list wont save since this is an embed, just go on the source page if you want to use it. This is mostly for documentation purpose, this is one of the most extensive pet list there is. It just miss the picture for foods and pets, so if ever you need to see them just use the [Pet&Food Model Catalogue](https://imgur.com/a/DbxyhwB)
