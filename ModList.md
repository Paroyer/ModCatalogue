## Introduction

This is the list of all the known/relevant mods for cubeworld. They are listed as their actual .dll name for convenience, that way you can look up if you have a mod in your /Mods folder that you dont know the source or what it does. It is worth mentioning that some .cwmod listed here have a .dll loader, that was usefull a couple days, but since the modloader have legacy support for .cwmod those .dll are deprecated (WeaponXP.dll / BrightNight.dll / BetterProgression.dll). Just delete them, keep the .cwmod and you wont get any error regarding the CWSDK version.

_**_Concept Mod_**_ is just a subjective way to say those mods are not 100% polished, which mean you may run into more bugs then with other mods.

*Mods with an asterix are those I consider noteworthy for some reasons.

_________________

***[CubeModLoader.fip](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/ModLoader) , [ChrisMiuchiz](https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz)*** : * What you actually need to mod the game. That one goes next to the cubeworld.exe and you create a /Mods folder where you put all the other .dll or .cwmod

***[BuildingMod.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/BuildingMod) , [ChrisMiuchiz](https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz)*** : * One of the best mods out there, it lets you build in cubeworld pretty straight forward

***[ChatMod.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/ChatMod) , [ChrisMiuchiz](https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz)*** : * Again one of the best mods, fix the chat actually not working in multiplayer

***[CommandsMod.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/CommandsMod) , [ChrisMiuchiz](https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz)*** : * Add commands to the base game, a lot of them are pretty usefull

***[BetterBiomes.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/BetterBiomes) , Julyuary*** : Kinda deprecated, not update by the original author for CWSDK-7.1 . Make one kind of biomes to vanish from the game.

***[BrightNight.cwmod](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/BrightNight) (~~BrightNight.dll~~) , Frognik*** : Could be nice to see comparison before/after.

***[WeaponXP.cwmod](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/WeaponXP) (~~WeaponXP.dll~~) , Frognik*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ Known to bug in some occasion, but nothing that major that would prevent you to play either.

***[Cubemod.cwmod](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/CubeMod) (~~BetterProgression.dll~~) , [ArisHack](https://github.com/arishackstv)*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ Not 100% polish, but a nice really nice concept regarding region lock. Important to know it use the rand() function and generate random pillar at some point ( you will see them dont worry :p )


***[ChangeSpecializationMod.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/ChangeSpecializationMod) , [ZaneYork](https://github.com/ZaneYork)*** : Add a command to change specialisation, exactly the same as going to the npc. May be usefull for brand new game you dont want to play X specialisation.

***[LocalizationMod.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/LocalizationMod) , [ZaneYork](https://github.com/ZaneYork)*** : Only usefull to translate the game, not usefull to most player but i thought it was nice to add it here in case.

***[InfiniteStackMod.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/InfiniteStackMod) , [ZaneYork](https://github.com/ZaneYork)*** : Bypass all the game stack limite, pretty usefull until there's a proper Capacity Fix mod for Apple/Lemon/Banana

***[ClassLoader.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/ClassLoader) , [Nichiren](https://github.com/thetrueoneshots)*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ * That one is a personal favorite, concept mod ( not 100% polish) but still amazing, there's a talent tree hiden in here ðŸ‘€

***[CrownMod.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/CrownMod) , [Nichiren](https://github.com/thetrueoneshots)*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ Little mod mostly unknown, let you ''wear'' a crown. The placement of some arent 100% accurate, but still another nice concept mod.

***[CubeMegaMod.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/CubeMegaMod) , [Nichiren](https://github.com/thetrueoneshots)*** : * Prolly THE best mod out there, a loooot of feature well explained on his GitHub pointless to repeat. Some have notice some interaction problem after a while under water or for other reasons, it's a known bug atm the only fix is to restart the game. May cause weird interaction with other mod that modifie the region lock, turn off mod id 8 in such case.

***[CubeGression.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/CubeGression) , [Nichiren](https://github.com/thetrueoneshots)*** : * Amazing: Add artifacts combat stats, pretty amazing if you want more meaningfull ''bonus'' for each level.

***[CubeMoneyScaler.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/CubeMoneyScaler) , [Nichiren](https://github.com/thetrueoneshots)*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ Scale your damage with how much gold you have.

***[CubeScreenResizer.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/CubeScreenResizer) , [Nichiren](https://github.com/thetrueoneshots)*** : * Amazing: I consider this a fix, resizes your cubeworld screen as defined config file when loading the game :3 

***[PetChanger.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/PetChanger) , [Nichiren](https://github.com/thetrueoneshots)*** : In my mind that's an underrated one, add a command to change your pet. Totally a hack but it's pure fun !

***[TournamentClient.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/TournamentClient) , [Nichiren](https://github.com/thetrueoneshots)*** : Let you challenge your friend in swag arena :D (other mods not available with this one to limit cheat)

***[LichModsPvp.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/LichModsPvp) , [LichGroup](https://github.com/LockManipulator)*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ Add a pvp toggle command 

***[LichModsMonk.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/LichModsMonk) , [LichGroup](https://github.com/LockManipulator)*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ add a new class the monk a weaponless class. Some bugs are known with the megamod, and it overwrite 1 ranger abilities iirc. But dont worry it's comming soonish to the CubeMegaMod!

***[LichModsCubeTravel.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/LichModsCubeTravel) , [LichGroup](https://github.com/LockManipulator)*** : * A lot of people like this one : Let you use the Glider/Boat/Reins in any region, with cubemod.cwmod you may end up with multiple Special Items on the top left corner.

***[LichModsGuardianFix.dll](https://paroyer.github.io/ModCatalogue/Mods/LichModsGuardianFix) , [LichGroup](https://github.com/LockManipulator)*** : * Amazing : Fix the Guardian health bonus, 25% instead of 25 flat hp.
