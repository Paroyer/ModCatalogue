# Mod Catalogue Test

This is the list of all the known/relevent mods for cubeworld. They are listed as their actual .dll name for convenience, that way you can look up if you have a mod in your /mods folder that you dont know the source or what it does 

*Mods with an asterix are those I consider noteworthy for some reasons.

## ModList Recap Test

***CubeModLoader.fip , ChrisMiuchiz*** : * What you actually need to mod the game. That one goes next to the cubeworld.exe and you create a /Mods folder where you put all the other .dll or .cwmod

***BuildingMod.dll , ChrisMiuchiz*** : * One of the best mods out there, it lets you build in cubeworld pretty straight forward

***ChatMod.dll , ChrisMiuchiz*** : * Again one of the best mods, fix the chat actually not working in multiplayer

***CommandsMod.dll , ChrisMiuchiz*** : * Add commands to the base game, a lot of them are pretty usefull

***BetterBiomes.dll , Julyuary*** : Kinda deprecated, not update by the original author for CWSDK-7.1 . Make one kind of biomes to vanish from the game.

***BrightNight.cwmod , Frognik*** : Could be nice to see comparison before/after.

***WeaponXP.cwmod , Frognik*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ Known to bug in some occasion, but nothing that major that would prevent you to play either.

***Cubemod.cwmod (~~BetterProgression.dll~~) , ArisHack*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ Not 100% polish, but a nice really nice concept regarding region lock. Important to know it use the rand() function and generate random pillar at some point ( you will see them dont worry :p )


***ChangeSpecializationMod.dll , ZaneYork*** : Add a command to change specialisation, exactly the same as going to the npc. May be usefull for brand new game you dont want to play X specialisation.

***LocalizationMod.dll , ZaneYork*** : Only usefull to translate the game, not usefull to most player but i thought it was nice to add it here in case.

***InfiniteStackMod.dll , ZaneYork*** : Bypass all the game stack limite, pretty usefull until there's a proper Capacity Fix mod for Apple/Lemon/Banana

***ClassLoader.dll , Nichiren*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ * That one is a personal favorite, concept mod ( not 100% polish) but still amazing, there's a talent tree hiden in here ðŸ‘€

***CrownMod.dll , Nichiren*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ Little mod mostly unknown, let you ''wear'' a crown. The placement of some arent 100% accurate, but still another nice concept mod.

***CubeMegaMod.dll , Nichiren*** : * Prolly THE best mod out there, a loooot of feature well explained on his GitHub pointless to repeat. Some have notice some interaction problem after a while under water or for other reasons, it's a known bug atm the only fix is to restart the game. May cause weird interaction with other mod that modifie the region lock, turn off mod id 8 in such case.

***CubeGression.dll , Nichiren*** : * Amazing: Add artifacts combat stats, pretty amazing if you want more meaningfull ''bonus'' for each level.

***CubeMoneyScaler.dll , Nichiren*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ Scale your damage with how much gold you have.

***CubeScreenResizer.dll , Nichiren*** : * Amazing: I consider this a fix, resizes your cubeworld screen as defined config file when loading the game :3 

***PetChanger.dll , Nichiren*** : In my mind that's an underrated one, add a command to change your pet. Totally a hack but it's pure fun !

***TournamentClient.dll , Nichiren*** : Let you challenge your friend in swag arena :D (other mods not available with this one to limit cheat)

***LichModsPvp.dll , Lich Group*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ Add a pvp toggle command 

***LichModsMonk.dll , Lich Group*** : _**_Concept Mod_**_ add a new class the monk a weaponless class. Some bugs are known with the megamod, and it overwrite 1 ranger abilities iirc. But dont worry it's comming soonish to the CubeMegaMod!

***LichModsCubeTravel.dll , Lich Group*** : * A lot of people like this one : Let you use the Glider/Boat/Reins in any region, with cubemod.cwmod you may end up with multiple Special Items on the top left corner.

***LichModsGuardianFix.dll , Lich Group*** : * Amazing : Fix the Guardian health bonus, 25% instead of 25 flat hp.

***LichModsCubePatch.dll , Lich Group*** : * Amazing : Fix artifacts bonus that dont work properly in the base game.
