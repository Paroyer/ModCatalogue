# Custom Models

As custom models are kind off a really soft "mod" they have a separate page then the regular .dll/.cwmod. To modify .cub you can use CWME or MagicaVoxel + Vox2Cub, there's a lot of other tool for this but those are the main/best one

&bull;[CWME](https://www.cwmods.com/downloads/info54-CWME-CubeWorldModelEditor.html)

&bull;[MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/)

&bull;[Vox2Cub](https://github.com/ParanormalVibe/Vox2Cub)

## Exemple

[PokemonSprites](http://www.mediafire.com/file/51ftlcalp2qa2ut/Pokemon.zip/file)

&bull; I May do standalone page for each one of them at some point, if there's enough so that is a minimum relevant. We'll see
