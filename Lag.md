# How to actually play cubeworld on a shitty computer

As of general info I have a older gen I7 that only have 2.2ghz in turbo mode, which is under the minimum configuration for Cube World Release. Most of what imma discuss here is mostly based on the Release, but most should apply to alpha also. Personally the alpha run way more smoothly then the release on brand new instalation, but I still use the hollowed model cause that's sincerly a shitty laptop.
