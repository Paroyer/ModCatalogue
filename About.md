## About

>The goal of this GitHub Pages is to be the ''ultimate'' cubeworld reference, without redoing what other guide, reference or what not have already done. Most relevant links should be added, but I don't know everything about cubeworld. That's why I need your help, if ever you notice something odd, missing or that should be on this site, just hit me up via the contact page. On another note, as you may have notice I'm not a native english speaker. So I wouldnt be surprise if every single sentence on this site contain some mistakes, if you spot some and you're kind enough to contact me I would be pleased :3

>Hoping this may be usefull to some,
