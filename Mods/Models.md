# Custom Models

As custom models are kind off a really soft "mod" they have a separate page then the regular .dll/.cwmod. To modify .cub you can use CWME or MagicaVoxel + Vox2Cub, there's a lot of other tool for this but those are the main/best one

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; [CWME](https://www.cwmods.com/downloads/info54-CWME-CubeWorldModelEditor.html)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; [Vox2Cub](https://github.com/ParanormalVibe/Vox2Cub)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; [Plasma](https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz/Plasma-Writeup) is pretty usefull too, may require a little bit more knowledge, but you can do way more then just modifying .cub

## Exemple

[PokemonSprites](http://www.mediafire.com/file/51ftlcalp2qa2ut/Pokemon.zip/file)

&bull; I May do standalone page for each one of them at some point, if there's enough so that is a minimum relevant. We'll see
