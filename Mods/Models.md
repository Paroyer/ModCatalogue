# Custom Models

As custom models are kind off a really soft "mod" they have a separate page then the regular .dll/.cwmod. To modify .cub you can use CWME or MagicaVoxel + Vox2Cub, there's a lot of other tool for this but those are the main/best one

&bull; [CWME](https://www.cwmods.com/downloads/info54-CWME-CubeWorldModelEditor.html)

&bull; [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/)

&bull; [Vox2Cub](https://github.com/ParanormalVibe/Vox2Cub)

&bull; [Voxelizer](https://drububu.com/miscellaneous/voxelizer/?out=vox)

&bull; [Cub2Obj](https://github.com/ScottishCyclops/cub-to-obj)

&bull; [Plasma](https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz/Plasma-Writeup) is pretty usefull too, may require a little bit more knowledge, but you can do way more then just modifying .cub

## Exemple

Most of the custom models I know are on those 2 website :

&bull;[Cwmods](https://www.cwmods.com/)

&bull;[Gamebanana](https://gamebanana.com/games/5200)

[PokemonSprites](http://www.mediafire.com/file/51ftlcalp2qa2ut/Pokemon.zip/file)

[CommunityPack](https://www.mediafire.com/file/4qlsrg9jum6fhso/Community_Sprites_V.3.rar/file)

Also the non-existent weapon/armor fix

Maybe the Hollowed models modification too

&bull; I May do standalone page for each one of them at some point, if there's enough so that is a minimum relevant. We'll see
