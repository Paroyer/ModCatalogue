# ModLoader

This is what you need to actually mod the game. That one goes next to the cubeworld.exe and you create a /Mods folder where you put all the other .dll or .cwmod
  
## Side Note

If you actually want to create a mod, you need to look at this: [CWSDK](https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz/CWSDK)
