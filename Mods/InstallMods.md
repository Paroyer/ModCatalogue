# InstallMods

I personally recommend creating a /Mods and /InactiveMods folder and just copy/paste what you want to use or not.

## SomeTest

0-Locate cubeworld folder, default path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cube World

1-Download ModLoader, drag and drop next to cubeworld.exe

2-Create a /Mods folder

3-Drop mod .dll/.cwmod inside /Mods

4-Launch .exe, select if you want to play with Mods or no, then a message will appear and confirm you which mods are loaded

>You may need the unpacked exe if ever some mods dont launch, but somepeople report they always used the default .exe. 
>
>Just look at steamless documentation or grab that one : [Unpacked cubeworld.exe](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/329294754846343168/834495644994895872/cubeworld.exe)
>
>I personally recommend to rename your actual cubeworld.exe to cubeworld--packed.exe or what not, just in case.
