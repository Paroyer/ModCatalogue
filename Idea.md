## Mod Idea

Here's a list of Mod idea, most of them will probably never get implemented or will take some times. Even then I think it's always fun to brainstorn over some feature possibility in cubeworld. So dont hesitate to share your idea and 👍/👎 others suggestion as well!

<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="Paroyer/Comment" 
        issue-term="pathname"
        theme="github-dark"
        label="Comment"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
